OASIS INFOBYTE INTERNSHIP
I am a Web Developer. I decided to go with level one to show my expertise in JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3.
In Level 1; we were suppossed to create the following projects:
               Portfolio
               Temperature Converter
               Lading Page
All these three I have done them myself without any form of plagarism. My projects are very responsive and up-to-date with the new technologies in the field.
